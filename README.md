# Global Lake Hydrology Explorer
Global Lake Hydrology Explorer is a tool for predicting future water levels of lakes around the world using global precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff data. The tool visualizes all components of the water balance and uses a small model component to simulate lake water levels. It allows users to select any lake in the world and obtain a snapshot of its precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff.
