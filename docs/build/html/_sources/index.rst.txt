Welcome to Global Lake Hydrology Explorer's documentation!
==========================================================
**Global Lake Hydrology Explorer** (GLHE) is a Python library/project designed to visualize hydrology for lakes around the world and provide easy access to global data sources. The main twist here being
the usage of free global data products, so *no* prep work is needed (theoretically). It pulls data from the `HydroLakes database <https://www.hydrosheds.org/products/hydrolakes/>`_ and offers a *simple* and
*intuitive* interface.

**Disclaimer**: This project is written by a undergraduate student with limited knowledge in hydrology and programming. It is not intended to be used for any serious research. Please use it at your own risk.
