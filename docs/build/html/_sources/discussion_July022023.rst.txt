Status
------------

1. NWM is implemented wihtout the lakes that aren't recognizing
2. Changed the data access to class based.
3. Dropbox finished moving the data there as a backup. Won't access it unless required.

Worries
------------
1. NWM, haven't confirmed if lake inflow and outflow is just stream inflow and outflow. Doesn't include precip or evap.

Potential Updates
-----------------
1. Potential Optimization in NWM is all over the place. Takes about 50 minutes to run it once.
