- Demo is Done! Run:
.. code-block:: bash

        cd Global Lake Hydrology Explorer Directory
        python -m GLHE.ngrok_demo
        start ngrok in ngrok.exe with ngrok start --all to ports 8500 and 500
- Gotta make it flexible and interactive now is the next step. How to make the Demo good? Fast? Easy? Respond to the goals that I want?
- I want to make it so that people understand where the data is coming from and how it is used here.
