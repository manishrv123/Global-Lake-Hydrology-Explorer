Status & Updates
----------------
 - Cleaned up NWM
 - Added PubSub for README Information, hopefully there will be more use for it later on.
 - Also "LIME" - Lake Interface for Monitoring and Exploration and "CLAY" - Centralized Lake Data Acquisition and Yield
Planned Products
-----------------

1. UI -> It's need to be seperate from all of this stuff (Maybe directly from LakeOutputDirectory). So I think I'll make it only take like a generic csv for the main plots, and maybe like the validation grids only take in like netcdf or smthng. For the point product, like the NWM that should be pretty easy.
